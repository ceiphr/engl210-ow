        This project is intended to be a website
        which covers key events and people within the Trials of Oscar Wilde.
        In the navigation bar you will find
        a link to the timeline and profiles pages. The timeline page illustrates key events that are directly and
        indirectly connected to the trials. The profiles page is intended to display
        pseudo social media profiles for the major people involved in the
        trials. The website source code is the HTML and CSS which was hand coded
        for this project’s website. The work cited is an MLA formatted document
        containing all the sources to facts and media assets used in this
        project. I hope you enjoy what we’ve made.

        <h2 class="title is-4">The Trials in A Nutshell:</h2>
        Oscar Wilde is involved in a romantic relationship with Sir Alfred
        Douglas during the time of Wilde’s opening play, “The Importance of
        Being Earnest”. Alfred’s father the Marquess of Queensberry is disgusted
        by his son’s behavior and tries to tarnish Wilde’s reputation by sending
        him a card making claims that he is a “sodomite”. This leads to Wilde
        bringing charges against Alfred's father in the Queensbury trials, which
        instead results in incriminating Wilde for having relations with young
        men. Shortly after an official trail is brought against Oscar Wilde for
        homosexuality and 25 counts of gross indecency. He pleaded not guilty.
        After many months and three separate trials. Wilde was found guilty and
        sentenced to two years of hard labor. After completing his sentence he
        fled to France to live out the rest of his years with Alfred Douglas.
